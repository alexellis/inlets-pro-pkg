## Helm charts for inlets Pro

[inlets](https://inlets.dev/) consists of a client and a server portion.

When a client wants to expose a service publicly, or privately within a remote network, it connects to a server using its control-plane (a HTTPS websocket).

There is no need for your data plane to be exposed on the Internet, you can bind to a local LAN adapter, or a private ClusterIP. If you do want to expose your tunnelled services to the Internet, you can do with a NodePort, LoadBalancer or through Ingress.

Kubernetes v1.19+ is required for the helm charts provided in this repository, due to the various versions of the Ingress API, the minimum supported version will be `networking.k8s.io/v1`.
