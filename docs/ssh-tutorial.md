# Tutorial

Access your computer behind NAT or a firewall, remotely via SSH.

Scenario: You want to allow SSH access to a computer that doesn't have a public IP, is inside a private network or behind
a firewall. A common scenario is connecting to a Raspberry Pi on a home network.

## Setup your exit node

#### Using inletsctl
You will need to have an account and API key with one of the [supported providers](https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl#featuresbacklog), 
we are using Digital Ocean in this example. So download your access key to a file called `do-access-token` and put it in
your home directory.

We need to know the IP of the machine you want to SSH onto, in my case this was 192.168.0.99

First of all, download `inletsctl` to your local machine
```sh
# Install Inletsctl to /usr/local/bin
curl -sLSf https://inletsctl.inlets.dev | sudo sh


# Create an exit node
inletsctl create --access-token-file ~/do-access-token --remote-tcp 192.168.0.99
```
This should then create an exit node, which will forward all TCP traffic to through the client to the `remote-tcp` address
that we set, in my case `192.168.0.99`

We should also see an outputted command that we can use on the machine we want to ssh onto.


```sh 
  export TCP_PORTS="8000"
  export LICENSE=""
  inlets-pro client --connect "wss://206.189.114.179:8123/connect" \
        --token "4NXIRZeqsiYdbZPuFeVYLLlYTpzY7ilqSdqhA0HjDld1QjG8wgfKk04JwX4i6c6F" \
        --license "$LICENSE" \
        --tcp-ports $TCP_PORTS

```


#### Manual setup of exit node
Provision a VM on DigitalOcean or another IaaS provider.

Log in with ssh and obtain the binary:

```sh
curl -SLsf https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/releases/download/0.5.1/inlets-pro > inlets-pro
chmod +x ./inlets-pro
mv ./inlets-pro /usr/bin/inlets-pro
```

Find your public IP:

```
export IP=$(curl -s ifconfig.co)
```

Confirm the IP with `echo $IP` and save it, you need it for the client

Get an auth token and save it for later to use with the client

```sh
export TOKEN="$(head -c 16 /dev/urandom |shasum|cut -d'-' -f1)"

echo $TOKEN
```

Start the server:

```sh
sudo inlets-pro server \
  --auto-tls \
  --common-name $IP \
  --remote-tcp 192.168.0.99 \
  --token $TOKEN
```


## Configure your ssh agent

Our cloud exit node is already using port 22 for SSH access. This means we need to configure our machine to listen
for ssh connections on another port, let's use 2222

If we find the line in  `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` near the top that is `Port 22`, make sure it's un-commented
and add `Port 2222`

```
Port 22
Port 2222
```

It is recommend to disable password authentication, and instead rely on SSH Keys only.

> WARNING: make sure you have validated that SSH works using your SSH Key before disabling password authentication.
> If you don't check you may be unable to access your machine. You can use something like [ssh-copy-id](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/ssh-copy-id.1.html) 
> to help

set this line to `no`, it may also be commented out
```
PasswordAuthentication no
```

We now need to reload the service so these changes take effect

```
sudo systemctl reload sshd
```

## Start the inlets-pro client

First we need to download the inlets-pro client onto our remote machine 

```sh
curl -SLsf https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/releases/download/0.5.1/inlets-pro > inlets-pro
chmod +x ./inlets-pro
mv ./inlets-pro /usr/bin/inlets-pro
```

Use the command we saw earlier to start the client on our server,

```sh 
  export TCP_PORTS="2222"
  export LICENSE="<your lisence here>"
  inlets-pro client --connect "wss://206.189.114.179:8123/connect" \
        --token "4NXIRZeqsiYdbZPuFeVYLLlYTpzY7ilqSdqhA0HjDld1QjG8wgfKk04JwX4i6c6F" \
        --license "$LICENSE" \
        --tcp-ports $TCP_PORTS
```

We can now verify our installation by trying to SSH onto the public ip, using port 2222

```sh 
ssh -p 2222 user@206.189.114.179
```

If everything is setup correctly we should be logged into our remote machine
